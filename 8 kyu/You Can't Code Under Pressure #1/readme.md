# You Can't Code Under Pressure #1

## Description

This JavaScript code defines a function called `doubleInteger` that doubles an integer by multiplying it by 2.

### How It Works

- The function takes a single parameter, `i`, which is the integer to be doubled.

- It doubles the integer by multiplying it by 2.

- The function returns the doubled integer as the result.

## Usage

To use the `doubleInteger` function, provide an integer as its parameter, and it will return the integer doubled.

```javascript
const originalInteger = 5;
const doubledInteger = doubleInteger(originalInteger);
console.log(doubledInteger); // This will log '10' to the console.

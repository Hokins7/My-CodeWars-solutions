# PositiveSum Function

## Description

This JavaScript code defines a function called `positiveSum` that calculates the sum of all positive numbers in an input array and returns the result. 

### How It Works

- The `sum` variable is initialized to 0. This variable is used to accumulate the sum of positive numbers in the array.

- The code then enters a `for` loop that iterates through each element of the array. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i <= arr.length - 1`, effectively iterating over all elements in the array.

- Inside the loop, there's an `if` statement that checks if the current element (`arr[i]`) is greater than 0, which means it's a positive number.

- If the element is positive, it adds the positive number to the `sum` variable. This step accumulates the sum of positive numbers in the array.

- After the loop has processed all elements in the array, the function returns the final value of `sum`, which is the sum of all positive numbers in the array.

## Usage

To use the `positiveSum` function, simply provide an array of numbers as its parameter, and it will return the sum of all positive numbers in the array.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6];
const result = positiveSum(numbers);
console.log(result); // This will log '13' to the console.

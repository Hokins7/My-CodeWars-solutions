# Grasshopper - Object Syntax Debug

## Description

This JavaScript code defines an object named `rooms` for a zork-type game. The objective is to create different rooms (`first` and `second`) with descriptions and items. However, there were errors in the initial code that needed correction to make the game work correctly.

### Rooms

#### First Room
- **Description**: This is the first room
- **Items**:
  - **Chair**: The old chair looks comfortable
  - **Lamp**: This lamp looks ancient

#### Second Room
- **Description**: This is the second room
- **Items**:
  - **Couch**: This couch looks like it would hurt your back
  - **Table**: On the table there is an unopened bottle of water

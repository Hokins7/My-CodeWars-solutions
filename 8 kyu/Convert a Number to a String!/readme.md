# Convert a Number to a String! Function

## Description

This JavaScript code defines a function called `numberToString` that converts a given number to its string representation.

### How It Works

- The function takes a single parameter, `num`, which is the number to be converted to a string.

- It uses the `toString()` method, which is available for all JavaScript numbers, to perform the conversion.

- The function returns the number as a string.

## Usage

To use the `numberToString` function, provide a number as its parameter, and it will return the number as a string.

```javascript
const number = 42;
const stringNumber = numberToString(number);
console.log(stringNumber); // This will log the string '42' to the console.

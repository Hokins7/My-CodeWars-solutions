# Area of a Square

## Description

This JavaScript code defines a function named 'squareArea' that calculates the area of a red square based on the length of a circular arc. The result is rounded to two decimal places.

### How It Works

- The 'squareArea' function takes a single parameter, 'A,' which represents the length of a circular arc in degrees.

- It calculates the side length 'a' of the square using the formula for the length of a circular arc. The formula divides the input 'A' by the product of 2π (two times the mathematical constant π) and 90/360 (degrees in a quarter of a circle).

- The area of the square is calculated by squaring the side length 'a' using the 'Math.pow' function.

- To ensure the result is rounded to two decimal places, the 'toFixed' method is applied to the area, and the result is converted to a number using 'Number'.

### Usage

To calculate the area of a red square given the length of the circular arc, call the 'squareArea' function with the input 'A' as the parameter. It will return the area rounded to two decimal places.

```javascript
const arcLength = 45;
const squareAreaResult = squareArea(arcLength);
console.log(squareAreaResult); // This will log '0.16' to the console.

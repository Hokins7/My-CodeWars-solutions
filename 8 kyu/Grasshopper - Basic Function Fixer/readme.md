# Grasshopper - Basic Function Fixer

## Description

The JavaScript function `addFive` is designed to add five to a given number and return the result.

### How It Works

- The `addFive` function takes one parameter, `num`, which is a number.

- Inside the function, it adds five to the input number using the expression `num + 5`.

- The result is stored in a variable named `total`.

- The function returns the calculated result.

### Usage

To add five to a number, call the `addFive` function and provide the number as a parameter.

```javascript
const inputNumber = 7;
const result = addFive(inputNumber);
console.log(result);
// This will log 12 to the console, which is the result of adding five to the input number 7.

# Sort and Star

## Description

This JavaScript code defines a function named 'twoSort' that operates on an array of strings. It sorts the array alphabetically (case-sensitive) and returns the first string with asterisks ('***') inserted between each character.

### How It Works

- The 'twoSort' function takes an array of strings, 's,' as its input.

- It sorts the input array alphabetically using the default behavior of the 'sort' method. This sorts the strings based on their ASCII values.

- After sorting, the function retrieves the first string from the sorted array, splits it into individual characters, and joins them back together with '***' between each character.

### Usage

To use the 'twoSort' function, pass an array of strings as input. It will return the first string in the sorted array with '***' inserted between its characters.

```javascript
const inputStrings = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
const result = twoSort(inputStrings);
console.log(result); // This will log 'a***p***p***l***e' to the console.

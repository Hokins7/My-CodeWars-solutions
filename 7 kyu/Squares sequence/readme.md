# Squares Sequence

## Description

This JavaScript code defines a function called 'squares' that generates a sequence of squares. The sequence starts with a given number 'x' and continues by squaring the previous number to produce the next number. The sequence has a length of 'n' elements.

### How It Works

- The 'squares' function takes two parameters: 'x' and 'n'.

- It first checks if 'n' is zero or negative. If 'n' is zero or negative, the function returns an empty array.

- The function initializes an empty array 'arr' to store the sequence.

- It then enters a loop that runs 'n' times. In each iteration, it appends the current value of 'x' to the 'arr' array and updates 'x' to be the square of the previous value.

- The function returns the generated sequence as an array.

### Usage

To generate a sequence of squares, call the 'squares' function with the 'x' and 'n' parameters. It will return an array containing the sequence.

```javascript
const startValue = 2;
const sequenceLength = 5;
const result = squares(startValue, sequenceLength);
console.log(result);
// This will log [2, 4, 16, 256, 65536] to the console.
